@ eCommerce Checkout Flow Simulation

This project is a front-end simulation of a simplified eCommerce checkout flow built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It mimics the user experience of selecting a product, customizing options, and completing a secure checkout with simulated validation and payment behavior.

@ Overview

The project includes two main web pages:

- `landing.html`: Product display page with selectable color and quantity, dynamic pricing, and a "Buy Now" button.
- `checkout.html`: Secure checkout form for entering shipping and payment details, with order summary and transaction simulation.

@  Features

-  Product display with image, rating, description, and features  
-  Variant and quantity selection with live price updates  
-  Price calculation including tax  
-  Data persistence using `localStorage`  
-  Form validation (name, email, phone, address, card info)  
-  Simulated transaction outcomes:
  - Card ending in 1: Approved
  - Card ending in 2: Declined
  - Card ending in 3: Error

- HTML5 – semantic layout and structure  
- CSS3 – responsive styling, grid layout, custom buttons  
- JavaScript (Vanilla) – dynamic DOM manipulation, data handling, validation
